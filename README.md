## INTRODUCTION :
When the world came to an unanticipated halt during the initial days of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) at least you or someone you knew shared a laugh on imagining how it would be to meet your dentist via a video call. It was certainly hilarious and whimsical at first but as the time progressed and more and more things went downhill and global lockdowns were imposed, online healthcare visits be it your therapist or a general practitioner everyone started offering the care virtually. Zoom, Google Meet or any other virtual alternatives became synonymous to in person doctor visits.

Fundamentally a straightforward concept: 'Using technological methods and processes linked to it so as to facilitate patient-care and therefore the overall well-being of the general public'. 

## HISTORY:
Travelling and taking a trip to late 19 centaury we see the first reports of telemedicine used. In 1879 a year where world was just getting introduced to the electric bulbs, a telepho
ne call reported in The Lancet between a physician and a mother to determine whether the baby had croup (a virulent infection of the upper airway which obstructs breathing) was made. The physician listened to the baby’s cough through the phone at the time as reported. This menial but gigantic technological reform picked up pace through the coming decades and many scientists, doctor and other healthcare providers and experts kept on revolutionizing the field of telehealth and digital medicine. 

With the advent of artificial intelligence in the late 80s and 90s also described by many as the golden times for Digi-Health. The exponential growth within the community of healthcare providers due to the advancement in AI saw numerous digital communication organizations to be set all across the globe like:
- American Telemedicine Association, 
- EHTEL ( European Health Telematics Association) and (https://www.ehtel.eu)
- IMIA (International Medical Informatics Association) 

## PRESENT-DAY:
Once again reading into the data during the COVID-19 pandemic we can observe that how telemedicine became a need of the hour and its utilization was increased exponentially. During these harsh times ‘direct to consumer’ or ‘on demand’ telemedicine became a medium through which patients were screened despite being self-quarantined which yielded into better use of technology and certainly became cost effective. 

For example assessing respiratory symptoms or loss of smell/taste which were early indicators in many COVID patients were easily assisted via the telemedicine infrastructure so available. This means of triage maintained patient oriented care while protecting  patients and healthcare providers.

Apart from the coronavirus pandemic the use of telemedicine is documented highly amongst other medical specialties and it has grown significantly since the year 1990. Some of the medical specialties includes like psychiatrists, endocrinologists and rheumatologists are reported to have benefited the highest.

A Curriculum Shift- Preparing Future Doctors for Telemedicine:
The COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in both the clinical environment and medical education. So to  maintain students’ ability to participate in clinical encounters and continue learning in the new virtual environment, a telemedicine curriculum for clinical students was rapidly developed at Harvard Medical School (HMS) focusing on the knowledge and skills needed to conduct live video encounters. Curriculum leads created an interactive, flexible curriculum to teach students clinical skills, regulatory issues, professionalism, and innovations in telemedicine. 

Key lessons include: 
- the ability to cover a wide breadth of skills-based material with practical video
- recordings
- the flexibility of an online asynchronous modality conducive for students with competing academic demands
- Providing a sequenced and logical approach to telemedicine added to students’ self-reported learning, allowing immediate application of new concepts to an authentic clinical learning environment.

Next steps for this curriculum include potential improvements for future iterations of the course and anticipated applications for future students and faculty. For instance, students could conduct the virtual visit with faculty supervision and feedback and solicit reflections from others involved in the encounter, including patients, caregivers, or other members of the care team. 
In addition, the creation of virtual telemedicine objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) may serve as a formal assessment tool to objectively evaluate curricular effectiveness and as a means to ensure students are evaluated systematically in developing telemedicine competencies.

# START-UPS AND INVESTMENTS:

With this exponential growth in the technology sector and restrictions  the pandemic brought with it, there has been increase in the start-ups linked to this sector of telemedicine. Quoting Apple CEO ‘Tim Cook’-“HEALTH WILL BE THE GREATEST CONTRIBUTION OF APPLE TO WHOLE MANKIND” we can observe that how large tech companies are investing its resources into polishing and innovating better telemedicine or telehealth care for its consumers. (https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/1/6/visualising-apples-3-trillion-market-valuation)
>  Recently 'Apple' crossed the 3 Trillion USD mark

Some of the top telehealth providers across the world include:
1. ’Teladoc Health’ ( NYC, United States)- The company is well renowned to provide range of services from AI-based analytics to medical consultations with revenue forecast in the year of 2020 reaching approximately 180 million USD.

 ## TRENDS EMERGING IN LAST TWO YEARS:
 1. Observing the last two year google trends with specific words like virtual doctor visits or telehealth/telemedicine one can see that there was an exponential surge and interest in these topics and particularly in the initial months of the pandemic in between April 2020 and May 2020. 

2. Since then there has been a decline but a persistent interest in telehealth and the way it can revolutionize the medical field. Increased studies, debates revolving around the pros and cons of digital health and benefits are also on rise.
3. Demand of books linked to telemedicine and telehealth can also be observed as more interest is growing among the general and the scientific community to learn more in these domains. Books like ‘Research Anthology on Telemedicine Efficacy, Adoption, and Impact on Healthcare Delivery’ and many other are selling as high as 400 to 500 USD. (https://www.igi-global.com/book/research-anthology-telemedicine-efficacy-adoption/267378)

## CONCLUSION:
-- Venturing to the question that was proposed at the beginning one can distinctly discern that virtual visits to healthcare providers are becoming an essential and integral part of the modern world. Many big and significant companies are investing into this sector of healthcare and shaping it and making it more affordable and sophisticated.
-- Distance multidisciplinary collaboration and remote mentoring can alleviate the shortage of doctors, especially experts. Avoiding doctors’ unnecessary trips to and from contaminated areas can reduce unnecessary waste of substances and essential resources and time and cost and is a viable alternative to alleviating medical shortages.
-- Digital health comes with its fair share of concerns and issues but more research and studies within this branch of medicine will yield more innovation and therefore more regard will be given to it by governments, consumers and providers across the world.

Therefore, implying that ‘Virtual Visits’ will not just be part of the generations in coming future but will become an innate part of mankind in coming decades. It will be intertwined in day to day lifestyle of many.
